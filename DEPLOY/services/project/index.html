            <p class="lede">The most comprehensive service that we offer is to support you throughout a digital transformation project, from kick-off, through discovery, and into the creation and testing of a prototype.</p>
<p>This service is for when you’ve got something in mind, and need help with making change happy. It could be that you’re updating older systems and processes; bringing in new technology to support a website. It could be that you’re exploring the need for a new digital product and want to run some quick validation. It may even be that you’re wanting to transform how the organisation works with digital, and trying to solve some internal problems. Whatever the digital change you’re looking to make, we can work with you in the early stages as technology-agnostic, neutral partners who can help you to find the right solutions.</p>
<p>We’ll take your initial requirements and ideas, work to validate any assumptions and confirm what opportunities are available. We’ll then put together various options to explore in more detail, eventually working through to a prototype that we can share back with the people that sparked the desire for change.</p>

    <img src="/img/icons/svg/kickoff.svg" alt="Kick-off" />
  </div>
  <div class="columns small-10 medium-9 large-8">
  <h3>Kick-off</h3>
  <p>At the very beginning we'll make sure that we've gathered the right people to work on the project - both from your side and with any other partners. We'll make sure that everyone involved is on the same page for the project scope, vision, and how we'll be working together.</p>
  <p>The following steps may run sequentially, or we may decide to run mini repeating cycles.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="columns small-10 medium-9 large-8">
        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>At this step we'll focus on research, validation, and identification of needs, problems, and opportunities. This isn't just about regurgitating what you know - it's about challenging, looking with a fresh pair of eyes, and finding the opportunities that you haven’t. It'll be building on your previous thinking, but also not being scared to suggest other ideas.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="columns small-10 medium-9 large-8">
        <h3>Ideas and options</h3>
        <p>However we work, we'll build in mid-way points to discuss everything so far and how we’d like to approach things next. These sessions often take the form of working workshops where we can discuss priorities, what options are available to explore, and planning the details of next steps. We aim to bring the best from other industries and situations we've experienced, plus knowledge of up and coming technology and innovations, but also want your ideas.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="columns small-10 medium-9 large-8">
        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <p>Whether we're working on a new digital solution to a problem or, say, working to change a process in your business, we'll look to do some kind of prototyping. Creating something a bit more tangible really helps people to communicate their thoughts. This could be something we create in code, could be interactive mock-ups, or even paper-based depending on your situation.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="columns small-10 medium-9 large-8">
        <h3>Improve</h3>
        <p>The 'last' step is to work out what's next! You may decide that you want to take the prototype further into full implementation, which we're able to support on. Typically, we also find that at this point that everyone's excited by more possibilities than they were at kickoff - throughout this process we'll have gathered areas that may need investigating further, or the prototype may have thrown up previously unexplored ideas. This is why we often run repeat cycles to refine ideas or explore new things.</p>

<h2 id="previous-projects">Previous projects</h2>
<p>Our previous digital transformation project experience is broad, and spans a range of industries and needs. Some notable examples include:</p>
<ul><li>Supporting the <b>Manor Racing Formula One</b> team to review their traditional manufacturing processes in order to identify gaps where digital technologies could bring speed, accuracy, insights, and other enhancements to the team.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Re-architecting the <b>Henley College Coventry</b> student application and enrolment process to better support customer experience expectations, and to make college processes more efficient.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Supporting the creation of a prototype for <b>Innovate UK</b> by capturing requirements, running workshops, validating assumptions, profiling audiences, assessing data, creating a product concept, and making business change recommendations.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Oversee a <b>not-for profit’s website</b> redevelopment - from creation of the brief, resource procurement, requirements capturing, technology selection, maintaining vision and validating output.</li></ul>
<h2 id="what-does-this-cost">What does this cost?</h2>
<p>Projects tend to start at £10-15k. Whilst we follow a pretty standard process, there are elements that will be customised based on your needs and different options that we can use. If you’d like to get in touch we’ll get back to you to arrange a first call, after which you’ll get a better ballpark.</p>
