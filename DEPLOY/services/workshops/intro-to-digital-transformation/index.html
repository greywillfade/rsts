<p>This one-day training workshop has been designed to give organisations a practical introduction to exercises which can help kick-start digital transformation projects, and make change happen.</p>

<p>Change takes many forms. Perhaps you’re looking to change your ways of working to <strong>better support customers</strong>, or to <strong>build internal capabilities</strong>, <strong>tools</strong>, and <strong>skills</strong>. You may be thinking about <strong>modernising older systems and processes</strong>, setting your <strong>digital strategy</strong>, or trying to work out the <strong>structure and roles your teams</strong> need… but feel you need a little bit of a helping hand to know that you’re thinking about the right things.</p>

<p>This course will help you to understand what digital transformation means, how your business could benefit, and give you some skills to start making improvements.</p>

<p>This will be a hands-on workshop where the content will be based on real challenges and opportunities that your business is facing. A set of tried and tested activities will be used to walk you through a shortened version of a typical digital transformation project process, and you’ll leave with not only some great ideas to take forward within the business, but also new knowledge about how to make this happen.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h2>

<p>This course is perfect for companies who want to work better with digital technologies, and who need a bit of direction to focus their energy. You might be:</p>

<ul>
<li>An organisation who&rsquo;s looking to modernise internal processes and systems, to make them more efficient or future-proof.</li>
<li>A business who feels like they&rsquo;ve fallen behind in their use of and relationship with technology, and wants help to set a future strategy.</li>
<li>A consumer-focused company who&rsquo;s wanting to use technology to better support customers&rsquo; experiences.</li>
<li>A digital agency who wants staff to learn more about transformation to be able to better support clients.</li>
<li>Anyone who wants to learn new skills and ways of thinking about digital, to apply to their work environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Attendees don’t need any design or development experience of working with the web - just a willingness to look critically at current situations, to be able to imagine what could be better, and to have the drive to make it happen. We recommend a mix of diverse roles attend - from senior management through to those on the front lines day-to-day.</p>

<p>No laptops need to be brought along, and all materials will be provided.</p>
