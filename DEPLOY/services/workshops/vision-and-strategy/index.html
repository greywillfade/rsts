            <p>In this workshop aimed at senior leaders and digital teams, we&rsquo;ll go on a journey to map out your current relationship with digital, and understand where it should go next.</p>
<p>It may be that you have a strategy and want to further validate it, or perhaps you&rsquo;re wanting to take a step back and look at the future with a fresh pair of eyes. Either way, the goal of this session will be that you leave with a freshly defined direction for the future and a set of next steps for you to work through.</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>The material includes a set of activities (some of them even fun ones!) to get the participants engaging and sharing thoughts. It is very interactive, and does not include any classroom teaching - this is all about you. No special equipment is needed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best suited as a two-day session, but can be amended to run between one and three days as needed. Depending on the time available, I&rsquo;ll work with you to define the schedule, and to focus on any areas that you feel need more work.</p>
<h2 id="what-well-cover">What we’ll cover</h2>
<p>Depending on the length, we may look at some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a shared vision of what &ldquo;digital&rdquo; means to the people in the room, and the wider business.</li>
<li>Understanding who you&rsquo;re trying to help, and the problems that they have.</li>
<li>What good and bad look like.</li>
<li>Understanding what should and shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;digital&rdquo;; what&rsquo;s affected by other factors.</li>
<li>Looking at what others in your industry are doing (including how this may change in the future, and what we can learn from those who <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> in your industry).</li>
<li>Prioritising what&rsquo;s important to you.</li>
<li>Setting out a mission and vision statement.</li>
<li>Bringing everything together by collecting the key points of your strategy on a canvas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whos-it-for">Who’s it for</h2>
<p>This workshop is suitable both for those with a digital background and those without - it&rsquo;s actually better to have both types of people in the room at once if possible. We typically recommend that there&rsquo;s a selection of people from across your business involved (up to 12), however we can also run a more focused version intended purely for digital teams.</p>
<p>The day(s) are intended as a safe space to vocalise any thoughts, fears, or hopes for the future, and we encourage all attendees to come with that in mind.</p>
<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
<p>By participating in this workshop you’ll come away with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear understanding of the purpose of digital within your organisation.</li>
<li>A canvas which maps out the foundation of your future strategy.</li>
<li>A set of next steps for making this happen.</li>
<li>Enthusiasm and drive for the future!</li>
</ul>
