            <p>We’re experts in digital strategy, and can help you to make change happen — across your website and apps, internal processes, work practices, or teams.</p>

            <p>Whatever stage your organisation is at, you’ve probably hit something that would benefit from a fresh perspective. We’ve worked with all kinds of people across industries including <strong>travel</strong>, <strong>education</strong>, <strong>charity</strong>, and even <strong>professional motorsport</strong> (have a look at <a href="/work">what we’ve done</a> for more), aiding our customers with their digital transformation, setting out strategy, planning individual projects, and training people to give them skills so that progress can continue without us.</p>

            <p>We work as a collective and can be as embedded as needed, which allows us not only do help you drive change from within, but also lets us flex our team to whatever challenges you’re facing.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Officially founded in 2014 by Sally Lait, Records Sounds the Same came about after Sally was seeing similar problems come up again and again, both from her agency background and freelance work.</p>

            <p>Rather than simply bringing in experts to get a job done, more and more organisations were instead looking for independent advice; wanting to understand the options available to them and how to make the most of digital. Too many agencies push solutions and strategies that conveniently match their offerings, products, or skillsets. We don’t do this — we work with you to help you understand what you need, and then we find the best people to help you achieve that.</p>

            <p>No two projects have been exactly the same, and whilst we use recognised industry techniques on our projects, the approach and team members involved will change depending on your needs. We don’t have a fixed team sat waiting around for projects that only fit their skill sets, and we don’t sell everyone the exact same activities. You’re different to everyone else, so we need to be a bit different too.</p>

            <p>Hence the name, <strong>Records Sound the Same</strong>.</p>

            <p>It comes from a snippet of a lyric (“<em>And why do all the other records sound the same?</em>”) that struck a chord because of the differences and similarities we deal with within the industry. It’s a reminder and a challenge not to be afraid to defy conventions, and to always do what’s best rather than what’s easy.</p>
