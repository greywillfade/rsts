      <description>Blueprinting (or ‘service blueprinting’), like many valuable techniques that we use in modern day transformation has been around for a while now — Wikipedia lists it as being first described by G. Lynn Shostack in Harvard Business Review in 1984. With the rapid rise of service design (designing services for people, across all of the different channels that they use) as An Important Thing within the digital industry over the last few years, we’ve seen more and more people building blueprints into their processes, including many of the projects that I work on.</description>

      <description>Attend any front-end developer conference at the moment and you’ll undoubtedly hear the phrase “progressive enhancement” frequently mentioned. From the days where implementing “graceful degradation” showed that you cared a little bit more about people who weren’t using the latest shiny browser or device, the industry has now generally come to accept a different mantra as best practice: everyone should have a good experience regardless of their situation, and if they can handle shinier or fancier things let’s layer that on top as a bonus.</description>

      <description>You might be in a more day-to-day digitally-focused role, or a more strategic one where there’s less direct contact but digital is important to your roadmap. You may have in-house teams, or outsource. Your business may be a small start-up, a massive international company, or you may work agency-side. I’d like to reach a diverse range of people in every sense, from situation, to geography, technologies, and the people who work there.</description>

      <description>Working on a recent project, I tweeted that I was “Kicking off the week with a workshop to map out a technology (+non-tech bits!) ecosystem, look at the processes and data flows, the people involved, and start to think about opportunities and changes. One of my favourite types of work :)”
I was working with another consultant to help a business sense-check what they were doing, and to make recommendations to feed into their digital strategy.</description>

      <description>Without even realising it, you prioritise and re-prioritise constantly. By choosing to read this post, you’ve made a decision that it’s worthy of your time over that cup of tea you were going to make, or that email you’ve been putting off writing (thanks!). When left to ourselves we’re pretty good at working out what’s more or less important (even if we don’t always do the important things straight away). But what happens when we need to show our justifications, or when other people are involved?</description>

      <description>Over the years, working with people in very different environments I’ve frequently heard the phrase “if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it” roll off tongues. Targets, and measurements against them are commonly the way that companies decide how well they’re doing or act to change direction. Having an accurate, informed measurement of current status is useful when we’re planning how to do that thing better in the future.</description>

      <description>Digital transformation isn’t just about swapping pens and paper for fancy web apps. Sure, that can be a part of it, but it’s much more about our evolving relationship with technology. As such, this series of posts will look at a broad set of activities, intended to suggest some continuous improvement in your relationship with digital and the web, and to challenge you to think differently about your ways of working across all kinds of different areas.</description>

      <description>From reports of Russian interference in elections, to Twitter’s frequent double standards over what breaks its terms of service, or that [hand-drier] (https://twitter.com/nke_ise/status/897756900753891328?lang=en) that wouldn’t work if your skin tone didn’t match what it was expecting&amp;hellip; the web was in the news a lot. Even outside of more obviously problematic stories, exciting developments such as AI voice generation service Lyrebird or image generation capabilities raise follow-on ethical questions about how usage may develop in undesirable ways.</description>

      <description>Run by Chris and Bec, Prolifiko (and its earlier form, Write Track) is one of these smaller entities. It’s a productivity tool for writers, based around building habits and providing encouragement to set and meet little goals. They’re one of my longest-running relationships, but this has also evolved over time. This is the story of the work that I’ve been doing with them, plus some of Bec’s thoughts on the journey.</description>

      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s net magazine (issue 297) features an essay that I wrote, called &amp;lsquo;Thinking beyond websites&#39;. It talks about how websites and customers shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the boundary of our focus, and how we can look more broadly - thinking about different considerations, and applying web technologies and practices to a wider range of areas in order to bring about real change.
 &amp;ldquo;Think back to your latest digital project. I imagine it probably happened because something old had problems, or someone identified an opportunity to do better.</description>

      <description>Say you took a client and they said &amp;quot;design me a website that will look great with no changes in 10 years&amp;quot;. You would ______
&amp;mdash; Chris Coyier (@chriscoyier) July 27, 2017  It was so interesting to see people&amp;rsquo;s responses - ranging from flat out rejecting the client, accepting a challenge, laughing, or providing specific suggestions like saying to focus on minimalistic design and typography. The general consensus is that a request like this is unrealistic and as such it was treated as a bit of a joke by some.</description>

      <description>Digital transformation is everywhere at the moment. It can be found in dedicated company teams, in government, at conferences, and even on this site — as a digital transformation consultancy it’s what we do.
The phrase itself is not a new term by any stretch, but like many buzzword-tactic labels it’s suffered slightly under that wonderful ambiguity that comes whenever we try to pin down something quite abstract. It’s one of those things that has given me personally a sense of purpose and identity, but at the same time I always slightly cringe at saying it.</description>

      <description>In my last regular check in with one such client I spent some time writing full job descriptions for some potential new roles. We&amp;rsquo;d previously talked about the kind of people, the structure, and the relationships between the positions, and now it was time to create something to summarise those discussions.
In my former role as Head of Technology at Lightmaker UK, I had to write job adverts, review CVs and interview staff.</description>

      <description>Many typical projects often involve an expert review of a website as part of the initial discovery process, but in this instance there were a few more in the mix - over 200! The collection of websites that this investigation centered around were all community websites created and controlled by entirely different volunteers, using hugely varying technologies and approaches, but each was aligned in terms of purpose and relationship to the others.</description>

      <description>Any ground-up rewrite of a digital project can be a challenge, and whilst this iteration of the site is still a work in progress I wanted to document some of the key considerations from the journey so far.
Choosing a content management approach The choice of technology and site build actually got underway long before Katherine had finished. A lot of the copy was already done, plus the site structure had been defined, so the choice of technology was all about finding something to match.</description>

      <description>Using technology to communicate and work remotely can remove the burden of commutes, better support home lives, and even facilitate people working together who otherwise wouldn’t be able to. Living in rural East Anglia this is something I’m a big fan of. I spend a lot of my time travelling to clients, but technology means that I can also join daily stand-ups or planning meetings without having to waste a day on travel, as well as being able to regularly work and chat with people who are the other side of the country.</description>

      <description>This site currently doesn’t feel like it reflects what Records Sound the Same has become, either in terms of its content or branding. As such, I wanted to address both as a clean slate – engaging a professional (the lovely Katherine Cory) to work on the visual aspects, and starting from scratch to think about capturing who we work with, how, and why.
I’ve thoroughly enjoyed this approach of taking a step back and trying to define these elements.</description>

      <description>I’m going through a process at the moment where I’m redoing all of the copy for this site (yes, it’s redesign time), which is not something that typically comes very easily to me. I usually find it quite difficult to get the thoughts that I have in my head down in written form. When faced with a blank piece of paper I’m often too focused on precise wording and weighting of phrases, getting too hung up on these rather than the overall message.</description>

      <description>A common scenario is that many organisations have been building and rolling out tools in the form of native apps, primarily because of requirements around features that the web historically hasn’t offered, or browsers haven’t supported — for instance apps are often touted as the best way to do things like reading content offline, or having push notifications. Building a website and multiple apps for different platforms can be expensive and make maintenance difficult, however.</description>

OpenActive Client work this month was all about OpenActive, which is the banner we’re hanging over the physical activity open data work that I’ve been doing with the Open Data Institute and Sport England.
I wrapped up my work on the initiative for the year with a few key elements. Probably the most different for me was defining the Terms of Reference and putting together a call for Advisory Board members, which was blogged about on the ODI and OpenActive sites.</description>

      <description>Unsurprisingly it was bursting at the seams with buzzwords. Reading that article (or seemingly any of these annual thinkpieces) may lead you to believe that by this time next year everyone will have ’transformed’ their business so that all staff are working remotely alongside AI in AR/VR-enhanced worlds, receiving cups of tea via drones, with IoT devices and APIs generating a firehose of data in the background. I’m paraphrasing, of course, but my sadness around these articles is that they don’t reflect the reality of priorities for the majority of organisations out there.</description>

      <description>I usually try to keep my projects quite distinct, because I find that’s the best way to flex around the inevitable change that always happens once you get started. If I need to add in a few more days or jump on a train unexpectedly, that’s fine. Since October however, I was splitting time between two projects which actually worked really well because they complimented each other nicely. I talked a little bit about both of them in last month’s update.</description>

      <description>Japan One of the main factors for this was spending a nice big chunk of time travelling around Japan during September and into October. I absolutely love the country, and after two earlier trips over there in reasonably quick succession it somehow ended up becoming six years since my last visit. There’s something about the logical nature of it, the natural beauty and the technology, the culture, the readily available excellent tea selections, and of course the food.</description>

      <description>The result has been a mix of getting project work ticked off, plus some time for a lot of new business chats and working on things in the background. Working with an F1 team means flexing around people’s race schedules and our project also fell into the mandatory Shutdown period, which I used to catch up on quite a few areas. Here’s what I’ve been up to this month:

      <description>Wrapping up and catching up So what have I been up to? Well, sporadically throughout the month I did some little pieces to finish off my role in the Sport England/ODI data audit project that I talked about in my previous update. As I’d mentioned before, my bit of work was a small part in a much wider piece – almost a proof of concept in itself I suppose – and it was great to go back to the ODI offices after a while to see what they’d then moved on to do.</description>

      <title>Before Discovery</title>

      <description>This year I was involved in something that I’d never quite done before – a ‘pre-disovery-discovery’, or ‘pre-discovery’ for short. The full discovery phases were to be extensive as the landscape was extremely complex and it was known that it would require some extremely thorough research and prototyping. Before that body of work kicked off, the client wanted to undertake this mini phase, to make sure that efforts were focused and prioritised in the right areas, but it also turns out that there was also another benefit – identifying commonalities and shared functionality between streams that were previously being investigated separately, so that the further investigation could be better aligned with reality.</description>

      <description>However, June has been a pretty straightforward month and this will be a rather shorter update than most. Right at the start I’d planned to take a few days off, to enjoy being back at home after spending May in Scottish, Polish, and American hotels. Due to dates shifting, I actually ended up having a week to myself for gardening (sunny bits) and Overwatch (rainy bits – most of it). Despite having a mammoth backlog of business/side project things to do that have built up, I deliberately tried to give myself a bit of time away from that as it has been a draining couple of months.</description>

      <description>Every week in May involved at least one flight (sorry, environment), and a lot of time away from home. Building on the time I’d spent away in the previous month, it all added up to a pretty draining period and I’m glad to be back at home for a while now, not least to spend some quality time with my Xbox… I mean boyfriend…
Scottish transformation Half of the month was spent on the Scottish transformation Discovery project that I mentioned in my previous update and sadly can’t say too much about.</description>

      <description>April began with a continuation of the Discovery work I’d been doing with Innovate UKand the Open Data Institute, around making grants data more accessible to a variety of audiences. Myself and one of the ODI team travelled to Swindon in order to wrap everything up by playing back our findings, and I was thrilled that everything was so well received by the team that we had been working with. With Discovery complete, the wider team been discussing options and ownership for next steps and I’m looking forward to seeing what happens next.</description>

      <description>Olivia briefly introduced her company and detailed how they’d been live for a year but were really keen to get some guidance and strategic advice on their tech development and how they could improve the user experience. She had been working with an agency, but talked about how they really wanted to move towards building more of an internal team. Patchwork was already a functional platform for giving money (often for honeymoons) with a strong, engaged user base, but they had dreams of doing much more.</description>

      <description>The first full week brought with it a chance to get properly stuck in to the project that has taken up the majority of my time this month – my project with Innovate UKand the Open Data Institute, looking at how to make Innovate UK’s data more accessible (and crucially more useful), both internally and externally. After the kick-off in the last week of February I now had a full week of properly getting into background research and planning for upcoming interviews.</description>

      <description>The UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 (and Scotland, 2002) creates a public “right of access” to information held by public authorities. I’m always thrilled when a company brings up FOI requests as part of any Discovery process. Usually it’s in the context of “we’d like our new website to cut down the amount of contact and FOI requests we receive because it takes up so much of our time and resources”.</description>

      <description>The big move! After an excruciating year on several fronts, the start of February finally, finally heralded the move that had been hanging over me and messing up most of my plans for the latter half of 2015. I can’t begin to explain what a huge weight this was, both personally and professionally, and it is so great to be done with it. I’m now in Suffolk, very close to my ‘proper’ office but most importantly with a great home office that’s surrounded by quiet rather than a building site – hooray!</description>

      <description>Findings will often help to inform the next lines of enquiry for the project, and to provide an initial view of key features or user goals that may need to be focused on. Even if the site is to be completely replaced, learnings from the existing setup can be invaluable in planning and prioritising for the future. We can also do reviews periodically, to help us keep on top of improvements.</description>

      <description>For reference, the discussion-starting tweet from Chris was this:
From a friend: “I’m on the committee to pick a CMS for our entire university. Opinions?”
I’ll relay yours!
&amp;mdash; Chris Coyier (@chriscoyier) January 12, 2015  ‘CMS’, for those who are unfamiliar with the term, is an abbreviation of Content Management System. This, at its heart refers to the ability to manage content in a user-friendly way that doesn’t typically require any coding knowledge.</description>

      <description>We’re lucky, here in Colchester, that we have access to so much great East Anglian produce. From Mersea Island oysters, to Cromer Crab, to samphire, pork and more, the ingredients available round here are exceptional. In addition to food, possibly due to the fact that we’re one of Britain’s driest regionswe also have some great local vineyards and breweries. As CAMRA hold multiple beer festivals here a year, and we had some great food and drink festivals this summer, I’m slowly working my way through all of our ales.</description>

      <description>I’m working with the Open Data Instituteon a project at the moment, and besides getting incredibly excited about the stuff we’re working on (it’s amazingly cool), I love some of the little touches around the ODI’s office.
The first thing that I noticed back when I first came here a few months ago was the sign-in system at the front desk. With their permission, I couldn’t resist taking some photos and writing this post.</description>

      <description>So, third party systems eh? We love them for saving us time, for meaning we don’t have to focus our allocated hours, budgets, and effort on things that we know someone has already successfully built. Hands up anyone who has ever used a third party payment processing gateway, booking/registration system, or retail solution? That’s most of you then, apart from you there. Yes, you. The one who wants to build everything from scratch every time because then it’s done your way and you get off on the control.</description>

      <description>A very important part of many website builds, and one which is often overlooked, is the migration of existing data or the population of new content.
If all of your content is going to be created from scratch it&amp;rsquo;s best to establish upfront how best to standardise the collection of the required data. Spreadsheets following predefined formats can be imported through automation relatively easily, or perhaps, depending on timescales, content can be written straight into a content management system.</description>
