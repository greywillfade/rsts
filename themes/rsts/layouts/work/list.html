            <h2>Clients</h2>
            <p>We like to work with clients who are excited and open to embracing change, and who want to work closely together. Our projects are intended to help you learn new things as much as getting work done.</p>
            <p>Our work is primarily directly with our own clients, but we also occasionally partner on projects where our specialist expertise is required (or where we know we like working with the other people running the project).</p>

            <p>Our own clients are big and small - here’s a little selection (of people that we're allowed to mention):</p>

She listens and truly understands your tech issues, problem solves brilliantly, documents her thinking clearly and then communicates her recommendations in a straightforward and compelling way. If Sally wanted a permanent job and if we could afford to hire her 24 hours a day we would. She's a strategic genius and a genuinely good woman - authentic, honest, open and kind. Which really counts for a lot.</h5>
