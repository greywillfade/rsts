                        <p>We originally focused on discovery and planning for websites - uncovering user and business needs, potential opportunities, and what these meant for design and technology selection.</p>
                        <p>Since then, whilst planning websites was still something that people needed, we found our most successful projects focused on looking <strong><em>beyond</em> the browser</strong>, as a driver for more fundamental transformation and benefits.</p>

                        <h3>Thinking beyond websites</h3>
                        <p>We looked beyond <em>just</em> websites, and instead took a holistic view of working with the web to help make meaningful change happen for the people we worked with — whether across systems and products, processes, strategy, or culture.</p>
                        <p>We were an independent, technology agnostic, embedded partner who could understand specific situations as well as helping to give recommendations and skills to transform how you work.</p>

                <h5 class="full-width-testimonial-text">I had the privilege to bring Sally onto a core project within Manor Racing, where time was of the essence and people's availability was very restricted. Sally not only managed to rally up the troops and get access to all the resources she needed, she produced an astoundingly detailed overview of where our Operations team were vs. where they should be, with a step by step guide on how to get there and even working prototypes of some of the areas we should target first. Sally is incredibly engaging, friendly and deeply technical, whilst remaining approachable to the non-tech savvy people so that she gets the best out of them in order to help businesses embrace digital transformation.</h5>
