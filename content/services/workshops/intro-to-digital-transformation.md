This one-day training workshop has been designed to give organisations a practical introduction to exercises which can help kick-start digital transformation projects, and make change happen.

Change takes many forms. Perhaps you’re looking to change your ways of working to **better support customers**, or to **build internal capabilities**, **tools**, and **skills**. You may be thinking about **modernising older systems and processes**, setting your **digital strategy**, or trying to work out the **structure and roles your teams** need… but feel you need a little bit of a helping hand to know that you’re thinking about the right things.

This course will help you to understand what digital transformation means, how your business could benefit, and give you some skills to start making improvements.

This will be a hands-on workshop where the content will be based on real challenges and opportunities that your business is facing. A set of tried and tested activities will be used to walk you through a shortened version of a typical digital transformation project process, and you’ll leave with not only some great ideas to take forward within the business, but also new knowledge about how to make this happen.

## Who is it for?
This course is perfect for companies who want to work better with digital technologies, and who need a bit of direction to focus their energy. You might be:

* An organisation who's looking to modernise internal processes and systems, to make them more efficient or future-proof.
* A business who feels like they've fallen behind in their use of and relationship with technology, and wants help to set a future strategy.
* A consumer-focused company who's wanting to use technology to better support customers' experiences.
* A digital agency who wants staff to learn more about transformation to be able to better support clients.
* Anyone who wants to learn new skills and ways of thinking about digital, to apply to their work environment. 

Attendees don’t need any design or development experience of working with the web - just a willingness to look critically at current situations, to be able to imagine what could be better, and to have the drive to make it happen. We recommend a mix of diverse roles attend - from senior management through to those on the front lines day-to-day.

No laptops need to be brought along, and all materials will be provided.
