In this training workshop we’ll cover some of the exciting possibilities that the modern web brings us, and look at how these can bring benefits to both customers and your business itself.

You may have heard about “**progressive web apps**” (PWAs) but not really be sure what they are, or why some of the conversations around them (involving words like *‘service workers’*, *’performance’*, *‘offline’*, or *‘progressive enhancement’*) really matter &mdash; this will help to change that, and give you the confidence you need to understand where they, and other modern web options, can fit into your strategy.


## Format

The material will be delivered via a set of lessons followed with interactive activities.  No special equipment is needed.

This course can be adapted to suit a half- or full-day session. With a half-day session I'll work with you to define the areas you're most interested in, rather than trying to cover everything.


## What we’ll cover

Depending on the length, we may look at some or all of the following:

* **What do we think of when we think of websites, and apps?**
* **Introducing offline into your user experiences**
	* why this matters for you, and your site visitors
	* what you need
	* how to think about an approach
* **Extending the ways that you can interact with people**
	* getting on people’s home screens
	* notifications
    * Bluetooth
    * VR
    * payments
    * animations
	* most importantly, how to get the browser bar to match your brand, like all the cool kids do
* **Common use cases for new technologies, and how these apply to your situation**
* **Why this all matters, and the benefits that these can bring**

## Who’s it for
Whilst the setting is a hands-on workshop, this *won’t* be coding-focused, and no particular technical skills are needed. The intention is to provide strategic decision makers, non-development team-leads, and other people interested in the possibilities that the web can provide, a solid grasp of the concepts and impact… without them having to worry about ‘not being technical enough’ or any fear of asking stupid questions.

The goal is that you’ll leave excited about the capabilities available to you right now, and with a clear direction of what it means to introduce some into your business’ work, without fretting that you need to be a JavaScript expert first.



## Learning objectives

By participating in this workshop you’ll come away with:

* An understanding of some more modern browser capabilities and web technologies.
* A view of how these relate to your situation and the benefits that they can bring.
* Knowing the practical steps and considerations for how to introduce them.
* Gaining confidence to speak to in-house development teams or external partners on these subjects.
